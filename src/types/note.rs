/// There are two different mappings of piano notes to MIDI numbers. They both
/// agree that Midi note 0 is a C, but they otherwise differ by an octave. I
/// originally picked C4=60, because that was the top Google search result's
/// answer, but it seems like a slight majority thinks C3=60. I'm going to leave
/// it as-is so that I don't have to rename my test data files. I don't think it
/// matters because we're not actually mapping these to anything user-visible.
///
/// The numbers 0-11 are below C0, so we had to invent some terminology to
/// indicate Octave -1. I'm calling that octave "Sub0" because I needed the
/// enums to have legal Rust names.
///
/// These also correspond to
/// <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies>
