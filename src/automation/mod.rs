//! Support for changing the parameters of instruments and effects over time in
//! a programmatic, reproducible way.
//!
//! For example, suppose a producer wants a pan effect going
//! left-right-left-right throughout the whole song. This could be done by
//! manually turning a knob back and forth, but that's tedious, and it
//! especially won't work when rendering the final output to a song file.
//!
//! Using automation, the producer can instead configure an LFO to emit a
//! [ControlValue] each time its value changes, and then link that output to a
//! synthesizer's pan parameter. Then the synth's pan changes with the LFO
//! output, automatically and identically for each performance of the song.
//!
//! Controllable entities have one or more parameters that are addressable by
//! [ControlName] or [ControlIndex], which are discoverable through the
//! [Controllable] trait. The [Control](ensnare_proc_macros::Control) derive
//! macro, with `#[control]` derive parameters, usually implements this trait.
//!
//! All values that pass through the automation subsystem are normalized to
//! [ControlValue]s, which range from 0..=1.0. Sensible mappings exist for all
//! applicable types in the system.
